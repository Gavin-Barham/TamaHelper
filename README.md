## Introduction
TamaHelper is a simple Quality-of-Life companion app for UmaMusume that automatically shows you the effects of each choice while playing, so you don't have to search them yourself.

This app is up-do-date with the game as of August 10, 2025.

## Is it safe to use?
I designed this app for myself, and I'm going hard at the game. That's why not getting banned is my top priority. Going back and forth between the game and my browser to check what each event choice rewards got really tiring.

This app was made with this in mind "never interact with the game". The only thing this app does is capture your screen so it can read specific pixels, and if it detects choices, will read the name of the event and provide the information in real time. The game itself has no way of knowing this app exist while you play, so you're safe to use it.

All of the images and the information used by this app is stored locally inside the executable file, so it doesn't need connection to the internet. This also means I will need to update it whenever a new character or card is released, which I intend to do at least for the time being.

## Important Considerations
This app was designed to work on PC with a screen size of 1920x1080 and the game on full-screen. I've tested other screen configurations and resolutions and it works on those as well, at least for 16/9. I've added fallbacks for special resolutions such as WUXGA, but can't guarantee it working.

IMPORTANT!!! - Make sure the horseshoes at the left of each choice are not obscured by your cursor or any other window, as this app looks for exact pixel colors in those icons. This also applies for the event name at the top left.

Lastly, I'll be updating it as I use it. Right now it only detects multiple choices of 2 and 3 buttons only. It won't work with 4 or more choices, I'll update the application as these cases appear on my playthroughs.

## How to use:
1) Grab the app from [Releases](https://github.com/Wartificer/TamaHelper/releases) uncompress and run TamaHelper.exe. Then, click the "start" button.
2) Use the small preview on the bottom-left to make sure your correct screen is being captured, if not, open the settings menu at the top-right and switch screens.

## Plans for the future:
1) Add a timeline of G1 races + Notify current turn G1 races available. Useful for farming G1 Sparks.
2) Add a timeline to inspiration + beach vacation. Useful for planning stamina.
